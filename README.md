The project was created in goal of study. All pages was designed by myself.
There are some features in animation that was found in open source, but a little bit corrected in term of project style.

Open the project on CodeSandbox by the [link](https://y10fx6.csb.app/), that connected to this repository and synchronized.

There are lists of updates for the future:

1. Make filter by:

    - type of platform
    - release date

2. Make sort by:

    - release date (old->new & new->old)
    - name

3. Devide Home.jsx into 3 separate pages:
    - home page with three buttons (/home)
    - list of games (/games_ps, /games_xbox, /games_switch)
    - list description one game (/game`name`)
